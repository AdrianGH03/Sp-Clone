(WIP FOR NOW, UNFINISHED)

This is a spotify clone. It is just a personal project of mine to learn React, no other purpose. It is not meant to alter or replace spotify in any way.

DISCLAIMERS
 -- This clone works no different than an embedded playlist from spotify

 As per Spotify's developer policies
 
 -- All artist names, albums, and songs can be linked back to the actual spotify
    URL of each by clicking on them.

 -- In addition, no images, cover arts, albums, were modified. 

 -- Only 30 second previews of each song are included, full tracks are not played.

 -- This app gains 0 monetization and is solely for demonstration and learning purposes.
